Even in silence, you are still moving forward.
What you carry is heavy, but it is also proof that you endured.
Not every step needs to be seen to matter.
You are allowed to rest without giving up who you are.
The path is unclear, but your direction is honest.
Some days are meant for surviving, not winning.
If you are still here, then something within you chose hope.
